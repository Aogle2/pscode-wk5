// Execerise 1: Calcualate the Sum of Two Numbers

Ask user for two numbers;

take first number and add it to the other number.
State the result to user.
Dispose of two given numbers and result after user closes me.

//Exercise 2: Check if number is Even or Odd

Ask user for a positive integer

Take provided number and try to divide by 2, if it's 0, it is even, otherwise it is odd.

Print result to user, disposing past result to not confuse myself.

//Exercise 3: Write pseudo code will perform the following.

A) Read in 5 seperate numbers.
B) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
C) Find the smallest and largest of the five entered numbers.	
D) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

User has given me five numbers, I'm going to push them into an array to make things easer to work with, I don't have to return anything to user for doing this.
User wants an average from given array, I'm going to add all numbers together and divide it by the total count of each integer in array.
User wants to know what the largest and smallest integers in the provided array.
I have built in functions for this, I can sort each number in a accending order, inform the user of this infomation.
